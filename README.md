# MachineLearning_Researching_Subject

## Required
* python3
* jupyter

## Dataset
U can look Data set on Folder DataSet
* training.csv
* test.csv

U can look solution in cleansing data by data.ipynb

### First Step 
####install libary of python
pip install -r requirement.txt

### Second Step
Open File .ipynb on jupyter

### Third Step
U can run Code by Cell in File .ipynb
File name is Model of Machine Learning
####Sample
* svm.ipynb is Model Support vector machine
* LogisticRegression is Model Logistic Regression
* knn is Model KNN
* decisiontree is Model Decision Tree

### Forth Step
See Result of Model
